# Metis-Project-1-MTA-Data-Analysis

*Project 1 of Metis Data Science Bootcamp.* Problem statement below:  


WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) is interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts for our annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year.

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.
